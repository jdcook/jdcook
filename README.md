## About Me
I'm a follower of Jesus who also happens to program while I wait for His second coming, and have been working on video games since around 2011. I'm currently working with **Unreal Engine**. I have also made games with [**Unity**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693310/Winging_It/), [**MonoGame**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/564080/Metagalactic_Blitz/), **XNA**, and **Phaser**.
